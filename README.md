This is a Python CLI to-do list applicaiton. It was kind of inspired by me wanting to experiment with the `Typer` library and `pytest` for the testing environment. Steps to use this project:

1. Download the repo
2. You can run this in a virtual environment (it makes it easier to manage dependencies). In MacOS, this is done with:

```
python -m venv venv
source myenv/build/activate
```
and you should be in your virtual environment, named `venv`.

**TODO**: Update README with instructions for Linux & Windows.

3. Install dependencies in the virtual environment. Run the following command (inside the virtual environment):

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And now you should be good to go!

Here are the basic functionalities that this app supports:

```

```

**TODO:** Update README with functions
